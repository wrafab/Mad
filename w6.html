<h3> Project |  Lamination, Vacuum Forming, Molding & Casting </h3>
<p> 
This week I made a longboard. I the board with green paint and a WRA logo on it. I built the board with layers of wood, which has specific sequence, in order to keep the board flexible while have it strong enough to hold a person on it. Then I press it with clamp for 24 hours.
I design a mold in stl format on the computer, then I carve it into a wax with a carving machine. In order to make a chocolate, I pour edible level silicon into the wax and then waited for 24 hours. Finally, I poured melted chocolate into the mold and then cool it down in a fridge.
This week is the best week so far. The hardest part of this week was to creat a mold from positive to negative. In order to have a proper shape for a chocolate, I need to think about it when I am making the stl file. 
 The final product, chocolate, was made from a negative model.
