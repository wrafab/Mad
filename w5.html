<h1> Week 4</h1>
<h2>3D PRINTING </h2>

<hr style="width:50%">

<h3> Project | Head on Model, additive project and pencil case </h3>
<p> 
This week I made three things. First, I combine my head model to another character's body. Then, I used 360 fusion autodesk to creat an additive shape. Finally, I made a pencil case with my classmate using 360 fusion.
The most difficult part of this week was to combine my head model to another character's body. 3D printing is very convenient when I am trying to make one model; however, it took me 5 hours to finish my model. As a result, 3d printing is not practical for mass production.
